# BT_Project
Take home project for an iOS developer position.

This take home project had a few requirements but essentially let me pick any public API and build an application.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Use a tableView to show data from a public API
2. Persist the data
3. Create a network layer for JSON consumption
4. Demonstrate understanding of asynchronous work (i.e. loading images)
